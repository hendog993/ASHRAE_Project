# ASHRAE_Project
Source codes for senior design ASHRAE trainer 

These codes work with the Arduino Genuino Uno board. 


2/4/19 Progress:
Inputs:
1. Potentiometer: This pot varies with resistance and acts as a switch between readings. 
2. The unit has two sensors: An analog temperature sensor, and a DLT Humidity + Temp sensor.
There are four outputs:
1. Analog temperature in Celsius
2. Analog temperature in Fahrenheit 
3. Digital Temperature in Celsius 
4. Digital Humidity in percentage. 

Soon to come:
- Arduino schematic as well as formal documentation. 
- Error messages 
- Better equipment.
- Breakout board: currently all inputs to the UNO are taken. Perhaps use a mega board? Or use a 
                  shift register. 
- Teach other team members.
